                <h2>My Background</h2>
                <p>I came to the United States from China in 2023 to pursue my academic goals. Since then, 
                I have been studying Cybersecurity as an undergraduate student at Kennesaw State University. Over the past year, 
                I have worked hard to maintain high academic standards, earning a place on the Dean’s List for the Fall 2024 semester. 
                I hold myself to a high level of expectation when it comes to my studies and personal growth. I am fluent in both Mandarin Chinese and English, and I currently work as a Chinese tutor at KSU’s World Language Resource Center, where I support students in their language learning journey.
                </p>
                
                <h2>KSU Experience</h2>
                <p>During my time at Kennesaw State University, I have dedicated myself to academic excellence across all my courses, 
                including Python programming, JavaScript development, and web technologies. 
                I strive to master both technical skills and critical thinking in every class. 
                Beyond individual study, I enjoy working collaboratively with my classmates, contributing to group projects that showcase both creativity and strong teamwork. 
                These experiences have strengthened my ability to solve problems, communicate effectively, and consistently deliver high-quality work.</p>
                
                <h2>Future Goals</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, I plan to use my bilingual skills and technical expertise to build a career in the cybersecurity field,
                     particularly within international business environments. 
                     I am passionate about protecting global digital assets and bridging communication across cultures. 
                     In addition to pursuing opportunities in the corporate world, I am also interested in contributing to cybersecurity 
                     initiatives in educational institutions, where I can help strengthen digital safety in academic communities.</p>
